# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition using Feedforward Neural Network (MLP)

This project demonstrates how to use a **feedforward neural network** (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP) to recognize handwritten digits from the `sklearn` digits dataset. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction visualization.

| **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** | A model inspired by the human brain, composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). It learns patterns from data to make predictions or classifications.     |
| â””â”€ **Neurons**                      | The basic computing unit in a neural network. It receives inputs, applies weights and bias, and passes the result through an activation function to produce output. |
| â””â”€ **Activation Functions**         | Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh that introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.                                                 |
| â””â”€ **Backpropagation**              | The training algorithm that adjusts weights by propagating the error backward through the network using gradients (partial derivatives).                            |
| **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**     | A type of feedforward ANN with one or more hidden layers. Each layer is fully connected to the next. It's the foundation of deep learning models.                   |
| **Feedforward Neural Network**      | A neural network where information flows only in one direction: input â†’ hidden layer(s) â†’ output. It has no loops or cycles.                                        |
